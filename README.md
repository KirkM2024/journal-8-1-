1. In this course I was trying to analayze specific data structures and determine their effectiveness for handling common problems faced when designing an effective computer program, in this case creating an application that reads a file from a CSV and seaches and sorts it.
2. How I approached this program was to determine the scope of the project and decide which data structure i should use. there were a lot of resources available online that helped with the input file reading as well as searching and sorting
using that I identified what would needed to be changed in order to be used int the associated data structure.
3. The main roadblocks i encountered were the data structures themseves, but once i became more aquanted with using nodes to hold objects building different data structures became easier.
4. This project has expanded my desire to write cleaner code, I think i would have had a rougher time without the well laid out code comments provided by the instructor.
5. I think the key point of creating maintainable and adaptable code is using the appropriate Data structure that has all that is needed within it to hold the data within it as an object from there you can build your program around how you are going to access and change the data.
